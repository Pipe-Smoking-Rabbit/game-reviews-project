# Game Reviews `(Front-End Project)`
This is my front end project centered around a small database of party / board game reviews. On the app it is possible to view a list of game reviews made by various 'users'. This list can be filtered by game category, and/or sorted by a number of criteria. It is possible to open a game review to view it in full, wherein which one can upvote or downvote, view attached comments, and even leave a comment of their own. This is done by user accounts, for which there is no verification. Simply navigate to 'switch user' and chose from a list.
